title:  "Retro Jet Mobile Game"

Retro Jet is a 2D infinite scroller where you have to dodge oncoming planets and avoid their gravitational pull. It's my first completed game using [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/). I used this project as a way to suss out how to publish an app on the Android store since I'd never done this before. Here are some screenshots:

You can download it yourself [**here**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.rocket&hl=en&gl=US).
