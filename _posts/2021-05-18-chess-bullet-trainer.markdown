My housemate is pretty into chess. He occasionally used this game called [**Don't Tap**](http://www.donttap.com/) to practice/warm up with. There were a couple of slightly annoying things about the game so he suggested I make my own version in [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/). I ended up spending my weekend coming up with:

I basically made a clone of *Don't Tap* and added a bunch of different grid sizes to choose from. I also added the option to skip the countdown since that was probably the most annoying thing about the other version.

I added two additional modes: *Vision* mode throws out chess board positions and gets you to click on them, *Precision* mode presents you with two pieces in random positions and gets you to capture the opposing piece.

I probably spent too long making it look pretty but at least it *looks pretty*. You can try it out yourself at [**itch.io**](https://haztro.itch.io/chess-bullet-trainer).

The code for the app is available on [**Github**](https://github.com/haztro/chess-bullet-trainer). It was a lot of fun to make but it's pretty hacked together so good luck if you do choose to dive in.
